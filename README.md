This project detects whether a job posting is real or fraudulent using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

Many fake job posts look genuine and trick people into sharing personal details. The goal of this project is to help identify such posts automatically.
Takes a job description as input

Analyzes the text content using NLP

Uses a trained machine learning model to predict:

✅ Real job

🚨 Fraudulent job

It also considers some missing-information flags (like missing company profile) because fake jobs often hide details.
High accuracy on test data

Good balance between precision and recall

Handles class imbalance properly

The model is trained and saved, so it loads instantly in the dashboard.
